# Airbnb-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an Airbnb dataset to gain insights into the data and visualize the findings using Power BI. The primary objective was to clean the dataset, explore its features, and create informative visualizations that can help stakeholders understand the trends and patterns in the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from kaggle. It includes various details about Airbnb listings, such as prices, customer ratings, room types, and more. Some columns, such as license, were deemed unnecessary for this analysis and were removed during the data cleaning process.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process was carried out using Python. The steps involved include:

Removing Unnecessary Columns: Columns that were not relevant to the analysis, such as license, were dropped.
Handling Missing Values: Missing data was either filled in with appropriate values or removed based on the context of the analysis.
Removing Outliers: Outliers that could skew the analysis were identified and removed.
Eliminating Duplicates: Duplicate records were deleted to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the data, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of various features and identify any interesting trends. This included analyzing variables such as:

Room Types: Distribution of room types across listings.
Cancellation Policies: Breakdown of cancellation policies.
Revenue by Neighborhood Group: Insights into revenue generation by different neighborhood groups.
Data Visualization
The cleaned dataset was then visualized using Power BI. The visualizations provided in this project include:

Key Metrics:

Total Revenue: $63.7M
Total Customers: 102.1K
Average Price: $625.4
Average Rating: 3.28
Average Service Fee: $125
Room Type Distribution: A pie chart showing the distribution of different room types.

Cancellation Policy Distribution: A visual representation of the different cancellation policies in place.

Revenue by Neighborhood Group: A bar chart highlighting the revenue generated by each neighborhood group.

Location Map: A map showing the locations of the Airbnbs across the region.

## Tools and Technologies
Python: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
Power BI: Used for data visualization and creating the dashboard.
## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into Airbnb listings, with visualizations that make it easier to understand key metrics, distribution of listings, and revenue trends. The project demonstrates the effective use of Python for data cleaning and Power BI for creating a compelling narrative through data visualization.
